## Development
You'll want to create a `.env` file with the following configurations:

```
  RETHINK_DB_PASS=sample_password
  RETHINK_DB_USER=sample_user
  API_SECRET=sample_api_secret
  PORT=3000
```

If your database isn't set up yet, you'll want to run the following command: `npm run db-setup`

Once the database is properly set up, run `npm run dev` to get up and rolling!
